# maintenance-drone-maintainer-mod
Stellaris game mod.

The aim of this mod is to remove the need to periodically micro the number of open maintenance drone jobs.

For gestalt empires, adds an edict called Maintenance Drone Maintainer.
This will add a modifier to colonized planets that reduces the number of available maintenance drone jobs if there are excessive amenities.
Every month planets are checked to update the correct number of jobs.
